                                Shipping times vary based on your location and the item. In-stock items typically ship
                                within 1-3 business days and arrive in 5-7 business days via standard shipping.
                                Made-to-order items take 7-14 business days to produce before shipping. Large furniture
                                items are shipped via freight and may take 7-10 business days for delivery. You'll
                                receive tracking information once your order ships.

                                Care instructions vary by material. Generally, dust regularly with a soft cloth, avoid
                                direct sunlight and heat sources, and clean spills immediately. For wood furniture, use
                                appropriate wood cleaner. For upholstered furniture, vacuum regularly and follow fabric
                                care instructions. Detailed care instructions are included with your furniture and
                                available on our website.
